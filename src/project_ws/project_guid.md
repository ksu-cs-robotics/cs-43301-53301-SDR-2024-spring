### Image Detection (YOLO):

in order to use yolo with ROS, we need to modify the `detect.py` with ROS subscriber to make it listen to ROS image instead of webcam on your PC, I made two new file call `yolo_ros.py` and `yolo_ros_connector.py` to replace the original `detect.py`. Everything else is excatly the same.

#### steps on how to use yolo with ROS:

**following steps are just highlight of the difference between `normal yolo` and `ROS yolo`.** the rest of steps are excatly the same the normal yolo

1. clone this repo
1. move all your yolo file into `project_tools/scripts` folder
1. record training video:
    1. install recording software: `sudo apt install vokoscreen`
    1. check out the `training.mp4` video at Slack chanel on how to do it
1. runing detection:
    1. ```
        # terminal 1 
        cd YOUR_PATH_TO_project_ws
        source devel/setup.bash
        roslaunch project_gazebo turtlebot_house_playground.launch
        ```
    1. ```
        # terminal 2
        cd YOUR_PATH_TO_project_ws
        source devel/setup.bash
        rosrun project_tools yolo_ros_connector.py
        ```
    1. ```
        # terminal 3
        cd YOUR_PATH_TO_project_ws
        source devel/setup.bash # you need to do this before you go into sub-folder
        cd src/project_tools/scripts/
        # command below only change the `detect.py` to `yolo_ros.py`. the rest is the same as yolo document
        python3 yolo_ros.py --data datafile.data --cfg yolov3-tiny-1cls.cfg --weights best.pt --source 0
        ```
