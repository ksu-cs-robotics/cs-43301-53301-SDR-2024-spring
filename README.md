### Prerequisite:
C or better in CS 13001 Computer Programming <br/>
C or better in CS 23001 Data Structure <br/>
C or better in CS 33201 Embedded System Programming (from 2020 Spring) <br/>

### Credits:
3 (The course satisfies a requirement for the Computer Science major and minor/ CS Graduate)

### Course Outline and Objectives:
Robots are being used in multiple places that are not easily accessible for humans, to support the lack of available labor, to gain extra precision, and for cost effective manufacturing processes, monitoring, space exploration, precision surgery and artificial limb support for elderly and physically challenged persons. Computer science is an integral part of robotics as it includes areas such as computer algorithms, artificial intelligence, and image processing that are essential aspects of robotics. This course will teach the students fundamentals of robotics along with various software, hardware for robot developments based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) which is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms. This course will provide hands-on experience with lab activities and practical knowledge from semester-long projects. During the semester, the students will build a Battle Bot based on a customized TurtleBot with ROS. And the class will host a battle bot competition at the end of the semester as a part of the class. This is a demo video (​ https://youtu.be/F-Cr1E8kr7c ) for the SDR class (CS 43301/53301-Software Development for Robotics).

|B-|80 – 82.4%|F|62% and below|

- **Reading Assignments:** The readings for this course will provide a broad and diverse knowledge in the field of Robotics. Some simple questions may also be posted on Blackboard LEARN for each reading, and answers to these questions should be submitted through BLACK Board by the due date.
- **Programming Assignments:** The programming assignments will provide practical experience in the field of Robotics. Most of programming assignments will be assigned during classes but some programming assignments may also be posted on Blackboard LEARN. All programming assignments should be submitted through BLACK Board by the due date.
- **Individual/Group Projects​:** The project activities are the majority of your out-of-class work for the semester. You will perform an individual & group project work in teams of 2~3, consistent throughout the semester. After forming teams early in the class, each team will improve and/or create new SW/HW design of a mobile-robot (custom turtle-bot) to address various issues and challenges. Each team will propose those challenges with the state-of-arts, will document their design and prototyping process, and will present project proposal and final presentation. In addition, each team member will have short-project progress presentation based on their assigned work in the project using a quad-chart (max 4 min).

### Course policy:
1. **Class participation and preparation**
    - Class participation and regular attendance are expected. If a student misses a class, the student is responsible for bringing herself/himself up-to-date on class material and assignments. If you miss more than 4 classes without a documented reason or without making prior arrangements with me, your final grade will be dropped one grade (A to B, B+ to C+ and so on).
    - All students are expected to read the assigned chapters prior to coming to class.
1. **Exams**
    - Exams will be based on the combination of: material covered in lectures, the assigned reading from the reference papers/textbooks and material covered in the notes.
    - All exams are closed books and closed notes.
1. **Homework assignments**
    - All homework assignments must be returned through the Blackboard LEARN. If the instructor requests to return an assignment directly in class, the assignment is due at the beginning of class on the specified date. Assignments turned in after the beginning of class on the due date will be counted as one day late and will receive 3 points of penalty.
    - Late penalty will be applied to all the assignment returned late. An assignment turned in n days late will get 3*n points deduction. An assignment cannot be more than 7 days late. After the 7th day the assignment will not be accepted.
    - All assignments must be individually and independently completed. Should two or more students turn in substantially the same solution or program, in the judgment of the instructor, the solution will be considered a group effort. All involved in group effort homework will receive a zero grade for that assignment. (See more details on cheating and plagiarism in the Academic Honesty Policy section below).
    - You may discuss the interpretation of an assignment with your classmates; however you may not discuss possible solutions unless you are requested by your teacher to share your solution with your colleagues.
    - No late assignment will be accepted after the assignment is graded and solution discussed.
1. **Make-up exams**
    - Make-up exams will only be given in case of serious need and only when the instructor is notified prior to the exam time. If this is not done, the grade is automatically 0 for that exam.
    - Written verification for the student’s inability to take an exam will be required.
1. **Class cancellation & Campus closings**
    - Announcements of class cancellations and/or campus closings will be made on the campus homepage. In the case of an emergency, weather-related or otherwise, please check the web page at www.kent.edu for information on the buildings and times of the closing. While information may be broadcast by radio and television, this should be confirmed by the web page, which is the official announcement of the campus and which will be the information used to determine issues related to student attendance, rescheduling of tests, and other concerns.
    - If I need to cancel class for any reason, I will try to put an announcement on the course web page as early as possible.
1. **Course Withdrawal**
    - If you are considering withdrawing from this course, please consult with a staff member in the Student Services Office, 134 Main Hall. Withdrawal from a course can affect financial aid, student status, or progress within your major. For withdrawal deadlines, please refer to: http://www.kent.edu/registrar/spring-important-dates.
1. **Academic Honesty**
    - Use of the intellectual property of others without attributing it to them is considered a serious academic offense. Cheating or plagiarism will result in a failing grade for the work or for the entire course. Repeat offenses result in dismissal from the University. University guidelines require that all infractions be reported to the Student Conduct Officer on our campus. Kent State University policy on academic honesty can be found at: http://www.kent.edu/plagiarism
1. **Students with Disabilities**
    - University policy 3-01.3 requires that students with disabilities be provided reasonable accommodations to ensure their equal access to course content. If you have a documented disability and require accommodations, please contact the instructor at the beginning of the semester to make arrangements for necessary classroom adjustments. Please note, you must first verify your eligibility for these through Student Accessibility Services (contact 330-672-3391 or visit http://www.kent.edu/sas for more information on registration procedures).
1. **Conduct**
    - Students and faculty behavior at the Kent State University is governed by the guidelines summarized in the Code of Conduct page that you can find at
http://www.kent.edu/studentconduct/code-studentconduct.
1. **Emergency**
    - In case of an emergency please contact the security on campus.
      - Pick up the receiver of any blue-light phone on campus
      - Security cell phone (330) 672-2212 or, of course, 911.
