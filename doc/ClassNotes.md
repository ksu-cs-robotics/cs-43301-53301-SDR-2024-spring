1. **Notes on working with Raspberry pi**

    1. if raspberry pi freeze or something suppose to work but doesn't work, try **unplug and plug back in**, if that doesn't solve the problem, try **google**

    2. when you do ```catkin_make``` on raspberry pi, use ```catkin_make -j2``` instead, **-j2** is gonna force raspberry pi only to use two core of CPU to compile. because raspberry dont have enough computing power, it will easily freeze if you dont use **-j2**

1. **command for check IP address:**

    the IP address of your PC may change when you in a different network. even when you in the same network, IP may also change from time to time
    - **ifconfig**    (linux)
    - **ipconfig**    (windows)

1. **Setup your connection with ROS Master:**
    - gedit ~/.bashrc **OR** nano ~/.bashrc
        - Enter these at the Bottom of your ~/.bashrc script:
            ```
                export ROS_IP=your.ip.address.here
                export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://master.ip.address.here:11311
                export ROS_HOSTNAME=your.ip.address.here
            ```

1. **Turtlebot3 Test and Play:**

    official manual page: http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/#turtlebot3-simulation-using-fake-node
    1. install: 
    ```sudo apt install ros-melodic-turtlebot3* ros-melodic-teleop-twist-keyboard ```

    2. Run Simulation: (you can run both on your PC when you test on your own)
        - **one PC:**
        ```
        export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle_pi
        roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo multi_turtlebot3.launch
        ```
        - **another PC:**
        ```
        rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py cmd_vel:=tb3_2/cmd_vel
        ## check the instruction show up on terminal when you run this code and try to control the robot.
        ```
