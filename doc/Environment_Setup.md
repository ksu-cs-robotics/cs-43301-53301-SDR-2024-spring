## üí¨ 0. Tools <a name = "tools"/>
#### We will use "Github" for homework submision and "Slack" for communication 

#### 0.1 Github: 
GitHub is a global company that provides hosting for software development version control using Git.

Instruction Link: [basic use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc)

#### 0.2 Slack
Slack is a cloud-based proprietary instant messaging platform developed by Slack Technologies.

Instruction Link: [basic use](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJmdHowChWk)

### Chanels: 
- **Github:** Please Fork this Repo into your account. if you do not know how to do that, please watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbSjyU2vf6Y)

- **Slack:** Please send an emial to Instructor (xlin10@kent.edu) about your Slack handle and email 

## üíæ 1. PC Setup <a name = "pc_setup"></a>
#### 1.1 Personal PC Setup
During this class, we are going to use [Ubuntu 18.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop) as our main operating system. 

# BACK UP ALL YOUR IMPORTENT FILES BEFORE YOU CONTINUE

##### 1.1.1. You Already Have Ubuntu 16 or You Want to Wipe Entire PC:

- **CASE 0 - BLANK INSTALL:** 
  check out 1.1.2. CASE 0. do the same thing but skip the first part where you particition on Windows

- **CASE 1 - UPGRADE:** 
  If you already have **Ubuntu 16.04** insteaded, it is *preferable* to upgrade to 18.04.
  ```
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo apt-get install update-manager-core
  sudo do-release-upgrade
  ``` 

##### 1.1.2. You Already Have Windows and You Dont Want To Wipe Anything:

- **CASE 0 - WINDOWS + UBUNTU (DUAL BOOT):** 
  Dual Booting installs both system. You can run one or the other full speed with full and full features, but only run one at a time.

  Instruction Link: [Dual boot Windows and Ubuntu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5QyjHIYwTQ) (Choose Option#1 - install ubuntu alongside windows boot manager) 

- **CASE 1 - WINDOWS + VIRTUAL MACHINE (VM):** 
  Running a VM allows running both system at the same time with full features, but slows down the VM (and potentially also the host).

  Instruction Link: [Virtual Box on Windows 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sB_5fqiysi4) (replace ubuntu *16.04* with *18.04*)

- **CASE 2 - WINDOWS + UBUNTU BASH (WSL):** 
  WSL is APIs and libraries to enable binary compatibility, but you aren't actually running Linux, and some programs are incompatible. Full speed, limited features.

  Instruction Link: [Windows 10 Bash & Linux Subsystem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cvrqmq9A3tA&t=243s). it does not provide a GUI interface.(you can use **X Servers** to bypass it, but it is bugyy to use)

##### 1.1.3. Install OS on Raspberry pi

- **CASE 0 Raspberry Pi 3:** Please follow [this video]() link to setup your raspberry pi

- **CASE 1 Raspberry Pi 4:** Since the offical Ubuntu support for raspberry pi 4 havent come out yet. You can install [Raspbian Buster with desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/), the setup process would be the similar as above.

- **!!->> DVI type monitor Setup: <<-!! (NOTES)** 
  ```
  sudo nano /boot/config.txt
  ```
  ```
  ### edit these lines ###
  hdmi_force_hotplug=1

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª 3. Software Setup <a name = "software"></a>

### 3.1. IDE
- **Raspberry pi:**

  Bluefish: ``` sudo apt install bluefish ```

- **Personal PC:**

  Visual Studio Code: check [this link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and download **.deb**
    1. Option 1: left click on the file to install 
    1. Option 2: open terminal and enter 
    ``` 
    cd ~/Downloads/
    sudo dpkg -i code_1.41.1-1576681836_amd64.deb 
    ## check the name of the file you just download, it might be different
    ```
### 3.2 Terminal Tool:
  - on both Raspberry pi and Personal PC
    ```
    sudo apt install terminator
    ```
    you can **right click** on Terminator to split windows, so that you can have multiple terminal in one windows

### 3.3 SSH
- **Raspberry pi:**

  enable ssh:
  ```
  sudo apt install ssh
  sudo systemctl enable ssh
  sudo systemctl start ssh
  sudo rm /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*
  sudo dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server
  ```

- **Personal PC:**

  1. **Ubuntu:** open terminal and install ssh ```sudo apt install ssh```

      **Windows:** [install putty](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html), under "MSI (‚ÄòWindows Installer‚Äô)" -> "64-bit" -> "putty-64bit-0.73-installer.msi"

  1. Generate ssh config file: open terminal (Ubuntu) or CMD (Windows), enter ```ssh remote_PC_username@remote_PC_IP_address``` for example, username for our raspberry pi is atr@cs-ksu, and ip is 192.168.1.31. so you need to use ```ssh atr@192.168.1.31```

  1. Open **Visual Studio Code** and click on **Extensions** on the left side, install "Remote - SSH **(Nightly)**" (this extension work best with "VS Code Insiders", but it is not required to have that, "VS Code" normal version would also work)
